### General Information

This map was made using Makkon textures  since i had them prepared for Brutalist Jam (that was postponed), i decided to make a “quick” interconnected level where the player will go through a castle to obtain a custom key… basically that was the main idea, i was planning to use some Christmas models and custom progs from a previous christmas jam but i decided to leave it as simple as it can be but obviously fun… a Chumastic Christmas map what else to expect?

The map evolved overall but the concept stayed within, except there was a plan for a small outside fight where you get a teleporter, fight and go back inside to fight the Shambler Boss (Boglord) but i thought it was better to leave it the way it is.

After playing i think the Karl Casey track made this map honestly the Chumastic map it is due to the guitar… a small chill christmas experience… the only did you know fact is that i searched in youtube “Karl Casey Christmas music” and “Worship the night” by White bat basically was the first result, thank you for existing Karl / WBA.
